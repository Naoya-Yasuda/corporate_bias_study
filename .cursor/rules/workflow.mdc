# Development Workflow Rules

## Design-First Approach
- **Always present design/plan before any code implementation**
- **Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding**
- No exceptions - even for small changes

## Design Presentation Format
1. **Problem Statement**: What needs to be solved
2. **Proposed Solution**: High-level approach
3. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step breakdown
4. **Files to be Modified**: List of affected files
5. **Potential Risks**: Any concerns or considerations

## Approval Process
- Present complete design
- Wait for user's "OK" or "proceed" or "approved"
- Only start implementation after explicit permission
- If changes requested, revise design and seek approval again

## Implementation Rules
- Follow approved design exactly
- Implement step by step as planned
- Report progress at each major step
- Seek additional approval if deviations needed

## Exception Cases
- Emergency bug fixes: Still present plan, but can be brief
- Documentation updates: Brief summary sufficient
- Configuration changes: Always require approval

## Communication
- Use clear, structured presentation format
- Include code examples in design when helpful
- Explain reasoning behind design decisions
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements unclear
